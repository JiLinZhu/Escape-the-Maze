# Escape-the-Maze
A multiplayer puzzle game where two players aid each other in overcoming obstacles and reaching the exit.
Designed during DEEP Game Development Camp using Allegro Game Programming Library for C++.


Note:
This game was created in July/August 2015 on Visual Studios, so it is slightly outdated (the files are also extremely messy). I am currently attempting to fix it using the most updated version of Allegro Game Programming Library and transform it to run on macOS.
